## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The client wanted a travel booking website that focused on niche, trendy destinations. Along the way, they added an additional focus on wellness vacations. As a start of the website, these were written in Java as a slideshow of five different destinations. Creating "user stories" helped by breaking up all the requirements into manageable tasks so progress could be tracked.

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs by looking at what the client wants at a high level and then break down their requirements into smaller pieces, mapping out how a program might work. I hope to incorporate Kanban boards and sprints (along with Sprint Planning and Sprint Retrospective events) to track progress and keep momentum up.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means being transparent about the work that you're doing, doing the work that you've committed to, and holding yourself accountable. You should do your best to not waste another team member's time, such as being late to meetings, but you should still ask for help. Asking for help isn't considered a waste of someone else's time.
